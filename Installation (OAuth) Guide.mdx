Rippling integrations rely on OAuth 2.0, in which Rippling is the server and your application is the client. At a high-level, Rippling will send the user to your redirect URL with a `?code=<xxx>` parameter when they install your application in Rippling. This provides the authorization that your application will utilize to exchange for access and refresh tokens.

## Requirements

To understand the installation flow requirements expected from apps in the Rippling App Shop, please navigate to [Partner Requirements](https://rippling.stoplight.io/docs/rippling-api/vxklq99t1i3xx-partner-requirements?_ga=2.139182579.130317931.1718918301-1683550397.1718918301).
