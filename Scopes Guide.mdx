Rippling Application Partners are required to explicitly provide Rippling with their necessary authorization scopes as part of their application. These scopes are displayed to Rippling customers during the installation process to ensure the transparent authorization of access to their company's information.

<Note>You may notice that certain fields are not marked as required in the Rippling API documentation. The information returned via these requests will be determined by the level of scopes your access token or API key is entitled to access.</Note>

If you notice that a particular capability or function that you require is missing, please reach out to partner.support@rippling.com for further assistance.
